        <li>Added Notification Center alerts on OS X Mountain Lion
        (10.8) and later.  Use Notifications System Preferences to
        customize the alert style and behavior. If you select the
        <b>Alerts</b> style, you can click the <b>Stop Repeating</b>
        button in an alert to stop a repeating alarm.  Unlike Growl,
        Notification Center only supports one type of alert per
        application, so the time remaining confirmation is not
        displayed as an OS X alert.  If you have Growl installed, it
        will still be used for this purpose unless you’ve turned it
        off.  Also unlike Growl 1.x, Notification Center does not
        inform Pester when an alert disappears from the screen, so
        repeating alarms don’t wait until you’ve dismissed the alert
        (or it disappears) to repeat.</li>
        <li>Don’t wait forever for Growl 2.0 and 2.1 before
        rescheduling a repeating alarm.  This affects repeating alarms
        for which you have <b>Notify with Growl</b> selected but
        not <b>Display message and time</b>.  More information about
        this issue is
        available <a href="http://njr.sabi.net/2013/08/07/growl-and-pester-repeating-alarms/">here</a>.

        <li>Optionally disable display of the time remaining until the
        next alarm in Pester’s Dock icon, in Preferences. (Thanks to
        Nur Monson for the contribution.)</li>
        <li>Permit entry of 12-hour single-digit hour/minute times
        without punctuation.  For example, you can now type
        “930a”.</li>
        <li>Mark repeating alarms in the Alarms window with a curved
        arrow icon.</li>
        <li>Remove an item from the Edit menu that didn’t do anything
        useful and should not have been there.</li>
        <li>Add Retina calendar and volume icons.</li>
        <li>Improve display of certain sound device names (such as
        those of AirPlay devices) so that they are consistent with the
        Sound menu extra.</li>
        <li>Update the natural language date
        parser, <tt>Date::Manip</tt> (fixes for Spanish, Finnish,
        French, Portuguese, Swedish and Turkish).</li>
        <li>Fix tabbing with Full Keyboard Access enabled.</li>
        <li>Improve playback of default alert sound.</li>
        <li>Improve display of long alarm messages in the alarm list
        window and notification alerts.</li>
        <li>Optionally log expired alarms to the Console.  (Note that
        you can also view expired alarms in Growl or Notification
        Center, if you have the corresponding alert enabled.)  This is
        not exposed in Pester’s user interface, but you can quit
        Pester, type <tt>defaults write net.sabi.Pester
        PesterLogAlarmTimerExpired -bool YES</tt> in Terminal and
        reopen Pester to enable logging; replace <tt>YES</tt>
        with <tt>NO</tt> to disable logging.  (Thanks to Mikey Reppy
        for the suggestion.)</li>
        <li>Fix speech previews playing through the wrong device when
        you change <b>Play sound through</b> in Preferences.</li>
        <li>Greatly improve error handling when restoring alarms and
