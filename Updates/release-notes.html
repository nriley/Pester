        <li>Fix yet another crash on launch because the (undocumented)
          storage format for speech voice selections changed again in
          macOS Sierra (10.12).  Pester now preferentially uses SPI
          rather than trying to parse files on disk, which may be more
          robust to future changes.  (Apple’s documented methods for
          obtaining voice lists have not kept pace with changes in how
          voices are downloaded and activated.)  Thanks to Ed Heltzel

          support for image/PDF display and playback of some movie
          formats; please let me know if (and why) you rely on any of

        <li>Added Notification Center alerts on OS X Mountain Lion
          (10.8) and later.  Use Notifications System Preferences to
          customize the alert style and behavior. If you select the
          <b>Alerts</b> style, you can click the <b>Stop Repeating</b>
          button in an alert to stop a repeating alarm.  Unlike Growl,
          Notification Center only supports one type of alert per
          application, so the time remaining confirmation is not
          displayed as an OS X alert.  If you have Growl installed, it
          will still be used for this purpose unless you’ve turned it
          off.  Also unlike Growl 1.x, Notification Center does not
          inform Pester when an alert disappears from the screen, so
          repeating alarms don’t wait until you’ve dismissed the alert
          (or it disappears) to repeat.</li>

          rescheduling a repeating alarm.  This affects repeating alarms

        <li>Permit entry of 12-hour single-digit hour/minute times
          without punctuation.  For example, you can now type

        <li>Add Retina calendar and volume icons.</li>
        <li>Improve display of certain sound device names (such as
          those of AirPlay devices) so that they are consistent with the
          Sound menu extra.</li>
        <li>Update the natural language date

          you can also view expired alarms in Growl or Notification
          Center, if you have the corresponding alert enabled.)  This is
          not exposed in Pester’s user interface, but you can quit
          Pester, type <tt>defaults write net.sabi.Pester
          PesterLogAlarmTimerExpired -bool YES</tt> in Terminal and

        <li>If you have no snooze time set, then choose “until,” then cancel, restore the previously selected snooze duration.</li>
        <li>Handle default alert device changing while Pester is running.</li>
        <li>Allow keyboard navigation of the Read Me.</li>
        <li>Expand selectable sound output device (in Preferences) to speech as well as alert sounds (Mac OS X 10.5 and later).</li>
        <li>Make date popup fully functional for German and Dutch.</li>
        <li>Fix some keyboard focus issues with alerts in the Set Alarm window.</li>

      <tr><th>Pester 1.1 beta 8 (31)</th></tr>
      <tr><td><ul>
        <li>Added customizable alert sounds—the most requested feature. The feature uses QuickTime, so you're welcome to pick a movie or even a bitmap or PDF to use instead.</li>
        <li>Added selectable sound output device (in Preferences) and adjustable volume for alert sounds. (Note: Pester doesn't yet respond to audio devices being connected/disconnected while it is running, although you should always get audio output <em>somewhere</em>.)</li>
        <li>Baseline, ICU-based support for non-natural language dates and times is much more robust (for example, simply “20” or “8p” works to specify 8:00 PM).</li>
        <li>Support natural-language dates in non-English languages via <tt>Date::Manip</tt>. I uncovered some bugs here, which the author of <tt>Date::Manip</tt> is working on fixing, but Catalan, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Polish and Russian should work fine. The date popup is limited to the days of the week, for now.</li>
        <li>Optionally wait until you stop typing or moving the mouse to display a message. This is quite helpful so you don't start typing into the Snooze box when you want to be typing into another document. The feature is disabled by default; enable it in Preferences.</li>
        <li>Handle time zone changes, many more time zones, and more reliably determine the time zone.</li>
        <li>Autocomplete common natural-language dates.</li>
        <li>Simplify tab ordering.</li>
        <li>Better save and restore focus when you're working as an alarm goes off; will no longer bring unwanted windows to the front.</li>
        <li>Open the Set Alarm window in the current Space when triggered with a keyboard equivalent or the Dock menu.</li>
        <li>Switch to tomorrow automatically if necessary when tabbing into “on”. If you specify a time that's already passed, while the specified date is today, simply tabbing into the date field will switch the date to tomorrow.</li>
        <li>Display “today” and “tomorrow” in the bottom left corner of the Set Alarm window.</li>
        <li>Open the Set Alarm window in the current Space when triggered with a keyboard equivalent or the Dock menu.</li>
        <li>If the Set Alarm window was visible when Pester was last active, prevent it from switching Spaces and obscuring a notification alert.</li>
        <li>(Re-)added optional dock icon bouncing, which works more reliably.</li>
        <li>Restored “today” item to date completion menus.</li>
        <li>Fix horizontal resizing glitches in the Alarms window.</li>
        <li>Save the most recent alarm message across runs of Pester.</li>
        <li>Disable the “–” button when it would do nothing.</li>
        <li>Added “days” and “weeks” alarm interval units.</li>
        <li>Allow specifying intervals up to 999 weeks.</li>
        <li>Many more bug fixes and full compatibility with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.</li>
